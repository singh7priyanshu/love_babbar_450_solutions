Rearrange the array in alternating positive and negative items with O(1) extra space

Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that
 every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance. 

Number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive
 numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear
  in the end of the array.

Examples : 

Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4}
Output: arr[] = {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}

Input:  arr[] = {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8}
output: arr[] = {-5, 5, -2, 2, -8, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0}

Naive Approach : 
The above problem can be easily solved if O(n) extra space is allowed. 
It becomes interesting due to the limitations that O(1) extra space and order of appearances. 
The idea is to process array from left to right. While processing, 
find the first out of place element in the remaining unprocessed array. 
An element is out of place if it is negative and at odd index (0 based index), 
or it is positive and at even index (0 based index) . 
Once we find an out of place element, we find the first element after it with opposite sign. 
We right rotate the subarray between these two elements (including these two).

Maximum profit by buying and selling a share atmost twice

In daily share trading, a buyer buys shares in the morning and sells them on the same day. 
If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, whereas the second transaction 
can only start after the first one is complete (Buy->sell->Buy->sell). 

Given stock prices throughout the day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.

Input:   price[] = {10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80}
Output:  87
Trader earns 87 as sum of 12, 75 
Buy at 10, sell at 22, 
Buy at 5 and sell at 80
Input:   price[] = {2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80}
Output:  100
Trader earns 100 as sum of 28 and 72
Buy at price 2, sell at 30, buy at 8 and sell at 80
Input:   price[] = {100, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80};
Output:  72
Buy at price 8 and sell at 80.
Input:   price[] = {90, 80, 70, 60, 50}
Output:  0
Not possible to earn.


We can do this O(n) using the following Efficient Solution. 
The idea is to store the maximum possible profit of every subarray and solve the 
problem in the following two phases.

1) Create a table profit[0..n-1] and initialize all values in it 0.

2) Traverse price[] from right to left and update profit[i] such that profit[i] stores 
maximum profit achievable from one transaction in subarray price[i..n-1]

3) Traverse price[] from left to right and update profit[i] such that profit[i] stores 
maximum profit such that profit[i] contains maximum achievable profit from two transactions 
in subarray price[0..i].

4) Return profit[n-1]

To do step 2, we need to keep track of the maximum price from right to left side, and to do step 3, 
we need to keep track of the minimum price from left to right. Why we traverse in reverse directions? 
The idea is to save space, in the third step, we use the same array for both purposes, maximum with 1 
transaction and maximum with 2 transactions. After iteration i, the array profit[0..i] contains the 
maximum profit with 2 transactions, and profit[i+1..n-1] contains profit with two transactions.

Algorithmic Paradigm: Dynamic Programming  

There is one more approach for calculating this problem using the Valley-Peak approach 
i.e. take a variable profit and initialize it with zero and then traverse through the array 
of price[] from (i+1)th position whenever the initial position value is greater than the previous 
value add it to variable profit.

But this approach does not work in this problem, that you can only buy and sell a stock two times. 
For example, if price [] = {2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4} then this particular approach will give result 6 while 
in this given problem you can only do two transactions so answer should be 4. 
Hence this approach only works when we have a chance to do infinite transaction.

Another approach:

Initialize four variables for taking care of the first buy, first sell, second buy, second sell. 
Set first buy and second buy as INT_MIN and first and second sell as 0. 
This is to ensure to get profit from transactions. Iterate through the array and return the second 
sell as it will store maximum profit.

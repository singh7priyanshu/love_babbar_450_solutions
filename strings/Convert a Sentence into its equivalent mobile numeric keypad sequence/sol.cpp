/*
Convert a Sentence into its equivalent mobile numeric keypad sequence.

Given a sentence in the form of a string, convert it into its equivalent mobile 
numeric keypad sequence. 

Input : GEEKSFORGEEKS
Output : 4333355777733366677743333557777
For obtaining a number, we need to press a
number corresponding to that character for 
number of times equal to position of the 
character. For example, for character C, 
we press number 2 three times and accordingly.

Input : HELLO WORLD
Output : 4433555555666096667775553

Follow the steps given below to convert a sentence into its equivalent mobile numeric keypad sequence. 
 

For each character, store the sequence which should be obtained at its respective 
position in an array, i.e. for Z, store 9999. For Y, store 999. For K, store 55 and so on.

For each character, subtract ASCII value of ‘A’ and obtain the position in the array pointed 
by that character and add the sequence stored in that array to a string.
If the character is a space, store 0
Print the overall sequence.
Below is the implementation of above method : 

*/
// C++ implementation to convert a
// sentence into its equivalent
// mobile numeric keypad sequence
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Function which computes the sequence
string printSequence(string arr[],
					string input)
{
	string output = "";

	// length of input string
	int n = input.length();
	for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
	{
		// Checking for space
		if (input[i] == ' ')
			output = output + "0";

		else
		{
			// Calculating index for each
			// character
			int position = input[i]-'A';
			output = output + arr[position];
		}
	}

	// Output sequence
	return output;
}

// Driver function
int main()
{
	// storing the sequence in array
	string str[] = {"2","22","222",
					"3","33","333",
					"4","44","444",
					"5","55","555",
					"6","66","666",
					"7","77","777","7777",
					"8","88","888",
					"9","99","999","9999"
				};

	string input = "GEEKSFORGEEKS";
	cout << printSequence(str, input);
	return 0;
}

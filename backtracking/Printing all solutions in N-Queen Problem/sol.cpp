Printing all solutions in N-Queen Problem

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens 
on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 
For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem.


0    q     0     0                    0    0     q     0

0    0     0     q                    q    0     0     0 

q    0     0     0                    0    0     0     q

0    0     q     0                    0    q     0     0

In previous post, we have discussed an approach that prints 
only one possible solution, so now in this post, the task is 
to print all solutions in N-Queen Problem. Each solution 
contains distinct board configurations of the N-queens’ 
placement, where the solutions are a permutation of [1,2,3..n] 
in increasing order, here the number in the ith place denotes 
that the ith-column queen is placed in the row with that number. 

For the example above solution is written as [[2 4 1 3 ] [3 1 4 2 ]]. 
The solution discussed here is an extension of the same approach.

Backtracking Algorithm 

The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, 
starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen in a 
column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. 

In the current column, if we find a row for which there is 
no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution. 

If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack 
and return false.

1) Start in the leftmost column
2) If all queens are placed
    return true
3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following
   for every tried row.
    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row
       then mark this [row, column] as part of the 
       solution and recursively check if placing  
       queen here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a
       solution then return true.
    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution 
       then unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) 
       and go to step (a) to try other rows.
3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, 
   return false to trigger backtracking.
A modification is that we can find whether we have a previously 
    placed queen in a column or in left diagonal or in right 
    diagonal in O(1) time. We can observe that 

1)For all cells in a particular left diagonal , 
    their row + col  = constant.

2)For all cells in a particular right diagonal, 
    their row – col + n – 1 = constant.

Let say n = 5, then we have a total of 2n-1 left and right 
diagonals

Let say we placed a queen at (2,0) 

(2,0) have leftDiagonal value = 2. Now we can not place 
another queen at (1,1) and (0,2) because both of these 
have same leftDiagonal value as for (2,0). 

Similar thing can be noticed for right diagonal as well.

Efficient Backtracking Approach Using Bit-Masking 

Algorithm: 
There is always only one queen in each row and each column, 
so idea of backtracking is to start placing queen from the 
leftmost column of each row and find a column where the queen 
could be placed without collision with previously placed queens. 

It is repeated from the first row till the last row. 
While placing a queen, it is tracked as if it is not making 
a collision (row-wise, column-wise and diagonally) with queens 
placed in previous rows. 

Once it is found that the queen can’t be placed at a particular 
column index in a row, the algorithm backtracks and change the 
position of the queen placed in the previous row then moves 
forward to place the queen in the next row. 

Start with three-bit vector which is used to track safe place 
for queen placement row-wise, column-wise and diagonally in each iteration.

Three-bit vector will contain information as bellow:
rowmask: set bit index (i) of this bit vector will indicate, 
    the queen can’t be placed at ith column of next row.
ldmask: set bit index (i) of this bit vector will indicate, 
    the queen can’t e placed at ith column of next row. 
    It represents the unsafe column index for next row falls 
    under left diagonal of queens placed in previous rows.
rdmask: set bit index (i) of this bit vector will indicate, 
    the queen can’t be placed at ith column of next row. 
    It represents the unsafe column index for next row falls 
    right diagonal of queens placed in previous rows.
There is a 2-D (NxN) matrix (board), which will have 
‘ ‘ character at all indexes in beginning and it gets filled 
by ‘Q’ row-by-row. Once all rows are filled by ‘Q’, the current 
solution is pushed into the result list.

Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

*/

// CPP program for above approach
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int> > result;
// Program to solve N Queens problem
void solveBoard(vector<vector<char> >& board, int row,
				int rowmask, int ldmask, int rdmask,
				int& ways)
{

	int n = board.size();

	// All_rows_filled is a bit mask having all N bits set
	int all_rows_filled = (1 << n) - 1;

	// If rowmask will have all bits set, means queen has
	// been placed successfully in all rows and board is
	// displayed
	if (rowmask == all_rows_filled) {

		vector<int> v;
		for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < board.size(); j++) {
				if (board[i][j] == 'Q')
					v.push_back(j + 1);
			}
		}
		result.push_back(v);
		return;
	}

	// We extract a bit mask(safe) by rowmask,
	// ldmask and rdmask. all set bits of 'safe'
	// indicates the safe column index for queen
	// placement of this iteration for row index(row).
	int safe
		= all_rows_filled & (~(rowmask | ldmask | rdmask));
	while (safe) {

		// Extracts the right-most set bit
		// (safe column index) where queen
		// can be placed for this row
		int p = safe & (-safe);
		int col = (int)log2(p);
		board[row][col] = 'Q';

		// This is very important:
		// we need to update rowmask, ldmask and rdmask
		// for next row as safe index for queen placement
		// will be decided by these three bit masks.

		// We have all three rowmask, ldmask and
		// rdmask as 0 in beginning. Suppose, we are placing
		// queen at 1st column index at 0th row. rowmask,
		// ldmask and rdmask will change for next row as
		// below:

		// rowmask's 1st bit will be set by OR operation
		// rowmask = 00000000000000000000000000000010

		// ldmask will change by setting 1st
		// bit by OR operation and left shifting
		// by 1 as it has to block the next column
		// of next row because that will fall on left
		// diagonal. ldmask =
		// 00000000000000000000000000000100

		// rdmask will change by setting 1st bit
		// by OR operation and right shifting by 1
		// as it has to block the previous column
		// of next row because that will fall on right
		// diagonal. rdmask =
		// 00000000000000000000000000000001

		// these bit masks will keep updated in each
		// iteration for next row
		solveBoard(board, row + 1, rowmask | p,
				(ldmask | p) << 1, (rdmask | p) >> 1,
				ways);

		// Reset right-most set bit to 0 so,
		// next iteration will continue by placing the queen
		// at another safe column index of this row
		safe = safe & (safe - 1);

		// Backtracking, replace 'Q' by ' '
		board[row][col] = ' ';
	}
	return;

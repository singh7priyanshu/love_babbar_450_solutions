Find if there is a path of more than k length from a source

Given a graph, a source vertex in the graph and a number k, 
find if there is a simple path (without any cycle) starting 
from given source and ending at any other vertex such that the 
distance from source to that vertex is atleast ‘k’ length.
 

Example:
Input  : Source s = 0, k = 58
Output : True
There exists a simple path 0 -> 7 -> 1
-> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4
Which has a total distance of 60 km which
is more than 58.

Input  : Source s = 0, k = 62
Output : False

In the above graph, the longest simple
path has distance 61 (0 -> 7 -> 1-> 2
 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5-> 6 -> 8, so output 
should be false for any input greater 
than 61.

One important thing to note is, simply doing BFS or DFS 
and picking the longest edge at every step would not work. 

The reason is, a shorter edge can produce longer path due 
to higher weight edges connected through it.
The idea is to use Backtracking. We start from given source, 
explore all paths from current vertex. We keep track of current 
distance from source. 
If distance becomes more than k, we return true. 
If a path doesn’t produces more than k distance, we backtrack.

How do we make sure that the path is simple and we don’t loop 
in a cycle? 

The idea is to keep track of current path vertices 
in an array. Whenever we add a vertex to path, we check 
if it already exists or not in current path. If it exists, 
we ignore the edge.
Below is implementation of above idea.

Exercise: 
Modify the above solution to find weight of longest 
path from a given source.
Time Complexity: O(n!) 
Explanation: 

From the source node, we one-by-one visit all the paths 
and check if the total weight is greater than k for each path. 

So, the worst case will be when the number of possible paths is 
maximum. 
This is the case when every node is connected to every other node. 
Beginning from the source node we have n-1 adjacent nodes. 
The time needed for a path to connect any two nodes is 2. 

One for joining the source and the next adjacent vertex. 
One for breaking the connection between the source and the old 
adjacent vertex. 
After selecting a node out of n-1 adjacent nodes, we are left 
with n-2 adjacent nodes (as the source node is already included 
in the path) and so on at every step of selecting a node our 
problem reduces by 1 node.
We can write this in the form of a recurrence relation as: 
    F(n) = n*(2+F(n-1)) 
This expands to: 2n + 2n*(n-1) + 2n*(n-1)*(n-2) + ……. + 2n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)…..1

As n times 2n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)….1 is greater than the 
given expression so we can safely say time complexity is: n*2*n! 
Here in the question the first node is defined 
so time complexity becomes 
F(n-1) = 2(n-1)*(n-1)! = 2*n*(n-1)! – 2*1*(n-1)! = 
    2*n!-2*(n-1)! = O(n!)

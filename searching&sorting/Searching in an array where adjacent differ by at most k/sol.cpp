Searching in an array where adjacent differ by at most k

A step array is an array of integers where each element has a difference of at most k with 
its neighbor. Given a key x, we need to find the index value of x if multiple-element exist 
to return the first occurrence of the key.
Examples: 
 

Input : arr[] = {4, 5, 6, 7, 6}
           k = 1
           x = 6
Output : 2
The first index of 6 is 2.

Input : arr[] = {20, 40, 50, 70, 70, 60}  
          k = 20
          x = 60
Output : 5
The index of 60 is 5

This problem is mainly an extension of Search an element in an array where difference between 
adjacent elements is 1.
A Simple Approach is to traverse the given array one by one and compare every element with 
the given element ‘x’. If matches, then return index.
The above solution can be Optimized using the fact that the difference between all adjacent 
elements is at most k. The idea is to start comparing from the leftmost element and find the 
difference between the current array element and x. Let this difference be ‘diff’. 
From the given property of the array, we always know that x must be at least ‘diff/k’ away, 
so instead of searching one by one, we jump ‘diff/k’. 
Below is the implementation of the above idea.

// C++ program to search an element in an array
// where difference between adjacent elements is atmost k
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// x is the element to be searched in arr[0..n-1]
// such that all elements differ by at-most k.
int search(int arr[], int n, int x, int k)
{
	// Traverse the given array starting from
	// leftmost element
	int i = 0;
	while (i < n)
	{
		// If x is found at index i
		if (arr[i] == x)
			return i;

		// Jump the difference between current
		// array element and x divided by k
		// We use max here to make sure that i
		// moves at-least one step ahead.
		i = i + max(1, abs(arr[i]-x)/k);
	}

	cout << "number is not present!";
	return -1;
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main()
{
	int arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 7, 7, 6};
	int x = 6;
	int k = 2;
	int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
	cout << "Element " << x << " is present at index "
		<< search(arr, n, x, k);
	return 0;
}

/*
Output: 
Element 6 is present at index 5

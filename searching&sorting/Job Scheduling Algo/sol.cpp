Job Scheduling Algo

Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.

Start Time
Finish Time
Profit or Value Associated
Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.
Example: 

Input: Number of Jobs n = 4
       Job Details {Start Time, Finish Time, Profit}
       Job 1:  {1, 2, 50} 
       Job 2:  {3, 5, 20}
       Job 3:  {6, 19, 100}
       Job 4:  {2, 100, 200}
Output: The maximum profit is 250.
We can get the maximum profit by scheduling jobs 1 and 4.
Note that there is longer schedules possible Jobs 1, 2 and 3 
but the profit with this schedule is 20+50+100 which is less than 250.  

The above problem can be solved using following recursive solution. 
 

1) First sort jobs according to finish time.
2) Now apply following recursive process. 
   // Here arr[] is array of n jobs
   findMaximumProfit(arr[], n)
   {
     a) if (n == 1) return arr[0];
     b) Return the maximum of following two profits.
         (i) Maximum profit by excluding current job, i.e., 
             findMaximumProfit(arr, n-1)
         (ii) Maximum profit by including the current job            
   }

How to find the profit including current job?
The idea is to find the latest job before the current job (in 
sorted array) that doesn't conflict with current job 'arr[n-1]'. 
Once we find such a job, we recur for all jobs till that job and
add profit of current job to result.
In the above example, "job 1" is the latest non-conflicting
for "job 4" and "job 2" is the latest non-conflicting for "job 3".

The implementations discussed in above post uses linear search to find 
the previous non-conflicting job. In this post, Binary Search based 
solution is discussed. The time complexity of Binary Search based 
solution is O(n Log n).
The algorithm is: 
 

Sort the jobs by non-decreasing finish times.
For each i from 1 to n, determine the maximum value of the schedule 
from the subsequence of jobs[0..i].
Do this by comparing the inclusion of job[i] to the schedule to 
the exclusion of job[i] to the schedule, and then taking the max.

To find the profit with inclusion of job[i]. we need to find the 
latest job that doesnâ€™t conflict with job[i]. 
The idea is to use Binary Search to find the latest non-conflicting job.

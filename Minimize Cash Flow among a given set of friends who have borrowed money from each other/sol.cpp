Minimize Cash Flow among a given set of friends who 
have borrowed money from each other

Given a number of friends who have to give or take 
some amount of money from one another. Design an 
algorithm by which the total cash flow among all the 
friends is minimized. 

Example: 

Following diagram shows input debts to be settled. 

           1000 Rs
    (P0)--------------->(P1)
      \                  /
       \                /
2000 Rs \              / 5000 Rs
         \            /
          \          /
           \        /
            \      / 
              (P2)

P0 has to pay 1000 Rs to P1 
P0 also has to pay 2000 Rs to P2
P1 has to pay 5000 Rs to P2.

Above debts can be settled in following optimized way  

  (P0)            (P1)
     \            /
      \          / 4000 Rs
3000Rs \        /
        \      /
         \    /
          (P2)
P1 pays 4000 Rs to P2
P0 pays 3000 Rs to P2

The idea is to use Greedy algorithm where at every step, 
settle all amounts of one person and recur for 
remaining n-1 persons. 

How to pick the first person? To pick the first person, 
calculate the net amount for every person where net amount 
is obtained by subtracting all debts (amounts to pay) from 
all credits (amounts to be paid). Once net amount for every 
person is evaluated, find two persons with maximum and minimum 
net amounts. These two persons are the most creditors and debtors. 
The person with minimum of two is our first person to be settled 
and removed from list. Let the minimum of two amounts be x. 

We pay ‘x’ amount from the maximum debtor to maximum creditor 
and settle one person. If x is equal to the maximum debit, 
then maximum debtor is settled, else maximum creditor is settled.
The following is detailed algorithm.

Do following for every person Pi where i is from 0 to n-1.  

Compute the net amount for every person. The net amount for 
person ‘i’ can be computed by subtracting sum of all debts 
from sum of all credits.

Find the two persons that are maximum creditor and maximum 
debtor. Let the maximum amount to be credited maximum creditor 
be maxCredit and maximum amount to be debited from maximum 
debtor be maxDebit. Let the maximum debtor be Pd and maximum 
creditor be Pc.
Find the minimum of maxDebit and maxCredit. Let minimum of 
two be x. Debit ‘x’ from Pd and credit this amount to Pc
If x is equal to maxCredit, then remove Pc from set of persons 
and recur for remaining (n-1) persons.
If x is equal to maxDebit, then remove Pd from set of persons 
and recur for remaining (n-1) persons.
Thanks to Balaji S for suggesting this method in a comment here.

The following is the implementation of the above algorithm.

// C++ program to find maximum cash flow among a set of persons
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Number of persons (or vertices in the graph)
#define N 3

// A utility function that returns index of minimum value in arr[]
int getMin(int arr[])
{
	int minInd = 0;
	for (int i=1; i<N; i++)
		if (arr[i] < arr[minInd])
			minInd = i;
	return minInd;
}

// A utility function that returns index of maximum value in arr[]
int getMax(int arr[])
{
	int maxInd = 0;
	for (int i=1; i<N; i++)

			maxInd = i;
	return maxInd;

// A utility function to return minimum of 2 values
int minOf2(int x, int y)
{
	return (x<y)? x: y;
}

// amount[p] indicates the net amount to be credited/debited
// to/from person 'p'
// If amount[p] is positive, then i'th person will amount[i]
// If amount[p] is negative, then i'th person will give -amount[i]
void minCashFlowRec(int amount[])
{
	// Find the indexes of minimum and maximum values in amount[]
	// amount[mxCredit] indicates the maximum amount to be given
	//				 (or credited) to any person .
	// And amount[mxDebit] indicates the maximum amount to be taken
	//				 (or debited) from any person.
	// So if there is a positive value in amount[], then there must
	// be a negative value
	int mxCredit = getMax(amount), mxDebit = getMin(amount);

	// If both amounts are 0, then all amounts are settled
	if (amount[mxCredit] == 0 && amount[mxDebit] == 0)
		return;

	// Find the minimum of two amounts
	int min = minOf2(-amount[mxDebit], amount[mxCredit]);
	amount[mxCredit] -= min;
	amount[mxDebit] += min;

	// If minimum is the maximum amount to be
	cout << "Person " << mxDebit << " pays " << min
		<< " to " << "Person " << mxCredit << endl;

	// Recur for the amount array. Note that it is guaranteed that
	// the recursion would terminate as either amount[mxCredit]
	// or amount[mxDebit] becomes 0
	minCashFlowRec(amount);
}

// Given a set of persons as graph[] where graph[i][j] indicates
// the amount that person i needs to pay person j, this function
// finds and prints the minimum cash flow to settle all debts.
void minCashFlow(int graph[][N])
{
	// Create an array amount[], initialize all value in it as 0.
	int amount[N] = {0};

	// Calculate the net amount to be paid to person 'p', and
	// stores it in amount[p]. The value of amount[p] can be
	// calculated by subtracting debts of 'p' from credits of 'p'
	for (int p=0; p<N; p++)
	for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
		amount[p] += (graph[i][p] - graph[p][i]);

	minCashFlowRec(amount);
}

// Driver program to test above function
int main()
{
	// graph[i][j] indicates the amount that person i needs to
	// pay person j
	int graph[N][N] = { {0, 1000, 2000},
						{0, 0, 5000},
						{0, 0, 0},};

	// Print the solution
	minCashFlow(graph);
	return 0;
}

/*
Output: 

Person 1 pays 4000 to Person 2
Person 0 pays 3000 to Person 2
Algorithmic Paradigm: Greedy 
Time Complexity: O(N2) where N is the number of persons.

Count Derangements (Permutation such that no element 
appears in its original position) [ IMPORTANT ]

A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that 
no element appears in its original position. 

For example, a derangement of {0, 1, 2, 3} is {2, 3, 1, 0}.
Given a number n, find the total number of Derangements 
of a set of n elements.

Examples : 

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
For two elements say {0, 1}, there is only one 
possible derangement {1, 0}

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
For three elements say {0, 1, 2}, there are two 
possible derangements {2, 0, 1} and {1, 2, 0}

Input: n = 4
Output: 9
For four elements say {0, 1, 2, 3}, there are 9
possible derangements {1, 0, 3, 2} {1, 2, 3, 0}
{1, 3, 0, 2}, {2, 3, 0, 1}, {2, 0, 3, 1}, {2, 3,
1, 0}, {3, 0, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 0, 1} and {3, 2, 1, 0}

Let countDer(n) be count of derangements for n elements. 
Below is the recursive relation to it.  

countDer(n) = (n - 1) * [countDer(n - 1) + countDer(n - 2)]
How does above recursive relation work? 

There are n – 1 way for element 0 (this explains multiplication with n – 1). 
Let 0 be placed at index i. There are now two possibilities, 
depending on whether or not element i is placed at 0 in return. 

i is placed at 0: This case is equivalent to solving the problem 
for n-2 elements as two elements have just swapped their positions.

i is not placed at 0: This case is equivalent to solving the problem 
for n-1 elements as now there are n-1 elements, 
n-1 positions and every element has n-2 choices
Below is the simple solution based on the above recursive formula:

*/
// A Naive Recursive C++ program
// to count derangements
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int countDer(int n)
{
  // Base cases
  if (n == 1) return 0;
  if (n == 2) return 1;
 
  // countDer(n) = (n-1)[countDer(n-1) + der(n-2)]
  return (n - 1) * (countDer(n - 1) + countDer(n - 2));
}
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    int n = 4;
    cout << "Count of Derangements is "
         << countDer(n);
    return 0;
}
/*
Output
Count of Derangements is 9
Time Complexity: O(2^n) since T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) which 
is exponential.

Auxiliary Space: O(h) where h= log n is the maximum height 
of the tree.

We can observe that this implementation does repetitive work. 
For example, see recursion tree for countDer(5), countDer(3) is 
being evaluated twice. 

cdr() ==> countDer()

                    cdr(5)   
                 /         \     
             cdr(4)          cdr(3)   
           /      \         /     \
       cdr(3)     cdr(2)  cdr(2)   cdr(1)
An Efficient Solution is to use Dynamic Programming to store 
results of subproblems in an array and build the array 
in bottom-up manner.

    der[1] = 0;
    der[2] = 1;
 
    // Fill der[0..n] in bottom up manner
    // using above recursive formula
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i)
        der[i] = (i - 1) * (der[i - 1] +
                            der[i - 2]);
 
    // Return result for n

Thanks to Utkarsh Trivedi for suggesting the above solution.

A More Efficient Solution Without using Extra Space.

As we only need to remember only two previous values So, 
instead of Storing the values in an array two variables 
can be used to just store the required previous only.

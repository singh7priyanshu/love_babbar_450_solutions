Minimum removals from array to make max–min <= K

Given N integers and K, find the minimum number of 
elements that should be removed, such that Amax-Amin<=K. 
After the removal of elements, Amax and Amin is 
considered among the remaining elements. 

Examples: 

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20} 
          k = 4 
Output : 5 
Explanation: Remove 1, 3, 4 from beginning 
and 17, 20 from the end.

Input : a[] = {1, 5, 6, 2, 8}  K=2
Output : 3
Explanation: There are multiple ways to 
remove elements in this case.
One among them is to remove 5, 6, 8.
The other is to remove 1, 2, 5

Approach: Sort the given elements. Using the greedy 
approach, the best way is to remove the minimum element 
or the maximum element and then check if Amax-Amin <= K. 

There are various combinations of removals that have to 
be considered. We write a recurrence relation to try every 
possible combination. There will be two possible ways of removal, 
either we remove the minimum or we remove the maximum. 

Let(i…j) be the index of elements left after removal of elements. 
Initially, we start with i=0 and j=n-1 and the number of 
elements removed is 0 at the beginning. 

We only remove an element if a[j]-a[i]>k, the two possible 
ways of removal are (i+1…j) or (i…j-1). 
The minimum of the two is considered. 

Let DPi, j be the number of elements that need to be removed 
so that after removal a[j]-a[i]<=k. 

Recurrence relation for sorted array:  

DPi, j = 1+ (min(countRemovals(i+1, j), countRemovals(i, j-1))
Below is the implementation of the above idea: 

*/
// CPP program to find minimum removals
// to make max-min <= K
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
#define MAX 100
int dp[MAX][MAX];
 
// function to check all possible combinations
// of removal and return the minimum one
int countRemovals(int a[], int i, int j, int k)
{
    // base case when all elements are removed
    if (i >= j)
        return 0;
 
    // if condition is satisfied, no more
    // removals are required
    else if ((a[j] - a[i]) <= k)
        return 0;
 
    // if the state has already been visited
    else if (dp[i][j] != -1)
        return dp[i][j];
 
    // when Amax-Amin>d
    else if ((a[j] - a[i]) > k) {
 
        // minimum is taken of the removal
        // of minimum element or removal
        // of the maximum element
        dp[i][j] = 1 + min(countRemovals(a, i + 1, j, k),
                           countRemovals(a, i, j - 1, k));
    }
    return dp[i][j];
}
 
// To sort the array and return the answer
int removals(int a[], int n, int k)
{
    // sort the array
    sort(a, a + n);
 
    // fill all stated with -1
    // when only one element
    memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
    if (n == 1)
        return 0;
    else
        return countRemovals(a, 0, n - 1, k);

The solution could be further optimized. 
The idea is to sort the array in increasing order and 
traverse through all the elements (let’s say index i) and 
find the maximum element on its right (index j) such that 
arr[j] – arr[i] <= k. 

Thus, the number of elements to be removed 
becomes n-(j-i+1). 
The minimum number of elements can be found by taking 
the minimum of n-(j-i-1) overall i. 
The value of index j can be found through a binary 
search between start = i+1 and end = n-1;

Approach:

The solution could be further optimized. The idea 
is to sort the array in increasing order and traverse 
through all the elements (let’s say index j) and find 
the minimum element on its left (index i) such that 
arr[j] – arr[i] <= k and store it in dp[j].

Thus, the number of elements to be removed becomes 
n-(j-i+1). The minimum number of elements can be found 
by taking the minimum of n-(j-i-1) overall j. 
The value of index i can be found through its 
previous dp array element value.
Below is the implementation of the approach:

*/
// C++ program for the above approach
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// To sort the array and return the answer
int removals(int arr[], int n, int k)
{
   
  // sort the array
  sort(arr, arr + n);
  int dp[n];
 
  // fill all stated with -1
  // when only one element
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    dp[i] = -1;
 
  // as dp[0] = 0 (base case) so min
  // no of elements to be removed are
  // n-1 elements
  int ans = n - 1;
  dp[0] = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
  {
    dp[i] = i;
    int j = dp[i - 1];
    while (j != i && arr[i] - arr[j] > k)
    {
      j++;
    }
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], j);
    ans = min(ans, (n - (i - j + 1)));
  }
  return ans;
}

  int a[] = { 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 20 };

Time Complexity: O(nlog n). As outer loop is going to make 
    n iterations. And the inner loop iterates at max n times 
    for all outer iterations. Because we start value of j from 
    dp[i-1] and loops it until it reaches i and then for the 
    next element we again start from the previous dp[i] value. 
    So the total time complexity is O(n) if we don’t consider 
    the complexity of the sorting as it is not considered in 
    the above solution as well.

Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Space Optimised Approach
The solution could be further optimized. It can be done in 
Auxiliary Space: O(1). The idea is to first sort the array 
in ascending order. 
Then keep 2 pointers, say i and j, where j iterates from 
index 1 to index n-1 and keeps track of ending subarray 
with the difference in max and min less than k, and i 
keeps the track of starting index of the subarray. 

If we find that a[j] – a[i[ <=k (means the i to j 
subarray is valid) we update the length from i to j in a 
variable to track of max length so far. 
Else, we update the starting index i with i+1. 

At first it seems that subarrays from i to j are ignored, 
but obviously their lengths are less than i to j 
subarray, so we don’t care about them.

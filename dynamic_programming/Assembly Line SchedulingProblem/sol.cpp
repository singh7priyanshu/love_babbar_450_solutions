Assembly Line SchedulingProblem

for better explanation please refer 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/assembly-line-scheduling-dp-34/

A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. 
A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and 
indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates 
the number of the station. The time taken per station is denoted 
by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work like 
engine fitting, body fitting, painting, and so on. So, a car 
chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before 
exiting the factory. The parallel stations of the two assembly lines 
perform the same task. After it passes through station Si,j, it will 
continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other 
line. Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost, but 
transferring from line i at station j – 1 to station j on the other 
line takes time ti,j. Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and 
exit time xi which may be different for the two lines. 

Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take 
to build a car chassis.


 

Assembly Line Scheduling Problem

The following information can be extracted from the problem 
statement to make it simpler: 

Two assembly lines, 1 and 2, each with stations from 1 to n.
A car chassis must pass through all stations from 1 to n in 
order(in any of the two assembly lines). i.e. it cannot jump 
from station i to station j if they are not at one move distance.

The car chassis can move one station forward in the same line, 
or one station diagonally in the other line. It incurs an extra 
cost ti, j to move to station j from line i. No cost is incurred 
for movement in same line.

The time taken in station j on line i is ai, j.
Si, j represents a station j on line i.
Breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems: 

We can easily find the ith factorial if (i-1)th factorial is known. 
Can we apply the similar funda here? 

If the minimum time taken by the chassis to leave station Si, j-1 is known, 
the minimum time taken to leave station Si, j can be calculated quickly 
by combining ai, j and ti, j.

T1(j) indicates the minimum time taken by the car chassis to leave 
    station j on assembly line 1.
T2(j) indicates the minimum time taken by the car chassis to leave 
    station j on assembly line 2.

Base cases: 
The entry time ei comes into picture only when the car chassis 
    enters the car factory.
Time taken to leave the first station in line 1 is given by: 

T1(1) = Entry time in Line 1 + Time spent in station S1,1 
T1(1) = e1 + a1,1 
Similarly, time taken to leave the first station in line 2 
    is given by: 
T2(1) = e2 + a2,1

Recursive Relations: 
If we look at the problem statement, it quickly boils down to the 
below observations: 
The car chassis at station S1,j can come either from 
station S1, j-1 or station S2, j-1.

Case #1: Its previous station is S1, j-1 
The minimum time to leave station S1,j is given by: 
T1(j) = Minimum time taken to leave station S1, j-1 + Time spent 
    in station S1, j 
T1(j) = T1(j-1) + a1, j

Case #2: Its previous station is S2, j-1 
The minimum time to leave station S1, j is given by: 
T1(j) = Minimum time taken to leave station S2, j-1 + Extra cost 
    incurred to change the assembly line + Time spent in station S1, j 
T1(j) = T2(j-1) + t2, j + a1, j

The minimum time T1(j) is given by the minimum of the two obtained  
    in cases #1 and #2. 
T1(j) = min((T1(j-1) + a1, j), (T2(j-1) + t2, j + a1, j)) 

Similarly, the minimum time to reach station S2, j is given by: 
T2(j) = min((T2(j-1) + a2, j), (T1(j-1) + t1, j + a2, j))

The total minimum time taken by the car chassis to come out of 
    the factory is given by: 
Tmin = min(Time taken to leave station Si,n + Time taken to exit    
    the car factory) 
Tmin = min(T1(n) + x1, T2(n) + x2)

Why dynamic programming? 
The above recursion exhibits overlapping sub-problems. There are 
two ways to reach station S1, j: 

From station S1, j-1
From station S2, j-1
So, to find the minimum time to leave station S1, j the minimum 
time to leave the previous two stations must be calculated
(as explained in above recursion).

Similarly, there are two ways to reach station S2, j: 

From station S2, j-1
From station S1, j-1
Please note that the minimum times to leave stations S1, j-1 and 
    S2, j-1 have already been calculated.
So, we need two tables to store the partial results calculated for 
    each station in an assembly line. The table will be filled in a 
    bottom-up fashion.

Note: 
In this post, the word “leave” has been used in place of “reach” 
    to avoid confusion. Since the car chassis must spend a fixed 
    time in each station, the word leave suits better.

Assembly Line Scheduling Problem Solution

The bold line shows the path covered by the car chassis for 
given input values. We need only the last two values in the 
auxiliary arrays. So instead of creating two arrays, we can 
use two variables.
